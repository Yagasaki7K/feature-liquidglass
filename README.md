# Apple Introduces Elegant and Beautiful New Software Design

A Universal Design Across Platforms, With More Focus on Content and a New Level of Vibrancy While Maintaining the Familiarity of Apple Software

Apple today previewed a beautiful new software design that makes apps and system experiences more expressive and engaging while maintaining a familiar feel. This new look is made with a material called Liquid Glass. This translucent material reflects and refracts the environment around it, dynamically transforming to highlight content and bring more vibrancy to elements like controls, navigation, app icons, widgets, and more. For the first time, the new design is coming to all platforms—iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 261—creating an even more cohesive visual language while maintaining the unique identity of each system.

“At Apple, we’ve always believed in the deep integration of hardware and software to make technology intuitive, beautiful, and a joy to use,” said Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design. “This is the biggest software design update we’ve ever done. Carefully crafted from a rethink of the fundamental elements that make up our software, the new design features our new Liquid Glass material, which combines the optical qualities of glass with the fluidity that only Apple can deliver, transforming with the content or context. This new design lays the foundation for even more incredible experiences in the future, making even the simplest interactions more fun and magical.”
